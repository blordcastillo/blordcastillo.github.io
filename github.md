#What is [GitHub](http://github.com)?  
Based on [Git](http://git-scm.com/), which was developed by <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Sv-Linus_Torvalds2.ogg">Linus Torvalds</a> to manage code for the Linux project. GitHub allows sharing on Git repositories online, and publicly.  
Other users can create copies of your code, and even push back changes that can then be pulled into your original code.  
  
##Social Coding
The ability to readily share your own code and contribute to other people's projects led to the phenomena of social coding. Social coding is nothing more than software development that emphasizes collaboration, particularly informal collaboration.  
But not everything on GitHub is "code".
