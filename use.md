#Now What?  
  
##Share!  
Publicize your repository and others will find uses for it.  
Some of these uses include:  
  
###[Edit on GeoJSON.io](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.io)  
  
###Use with your favorite web mapping API  
* Pull into [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html)  
* Pull into [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/en/master/examples/geojson.html)  
  
###Use in an application  
* Load into PostGIS with [ST_GeomFromGeoJSON](http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_GeomFromGeoJSON.html)  
* Load into [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) (which natively loads GeoJSON)    
* Work with it in [QGIS](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/30427/open-a-geojson-file-with-qgis)  
* (ArcGIS Desktop support is expected soon.)
  
###And upload to the cloud!
(Yes, technically GitHub is "the cloud" too.)  
* [To ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/publish-features.htm)
